See, my goal is to write a long description. Do you know what 'long' means? It means you should spend time reading it (long doesn't actually mean that but whatever). If this description ended after the first sentence, it wouldn't be long. That's why I'm stretching with useless words I put together while I was sitting alone on my laptop with nothing better to do. You see, I actually have better stuff to do. For example, I could watch South Park. If you don't watch it, you should give it a try. There is a fair chance that you don't like it actually, but on the off chance that you do, you'll probably fall in love with it forever. You might even end up marrying it, and do you know who is the one person that will surely be totally cool with this marriage? PC principal.",
